               Fog computing is more and more emerging as a paradigm for developing and deploying solutions able to balance between the scalability offered cloud based environments and the reduced latency guaranteed by the resources on the edge. For this reason, the Fog Computing paradigm suggests to move the computation closer to where the data are generated to reduce the data traffic and improve the performance of distributed systems. These systems are currently available in many domains: e.g., Smart Cities, Smart Transportation, Smart Industries. Data are usually collected by sensors, sent to the Cloud for the analysis and the result (other data) sent back to the edge to configure actuators. Although the current trend suggests to move the computation to where the data are generated, scalability and reliability offered by the Cloud cannot be replaced by any Edge environment. For this reason, data movement from the edge to the cloud must be preserved but also properly managed to not violate privacy and security issues.

               On this basis it is urgent to define solutions able to drive decisions on how, when, and where data must be moved considering the impact of such decisions on the quality of the system especially in terms of latency, data security and privacy, reliability. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in the area of Fog Computing in order to present and discuss methods and techniques to make the data movement efficient in Fog Computing.

            <h4>SUBMISSION DETAILS:</h4>
            <p>
               DaMove workshop is seeking for two types of contributions:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <b>research papers</b> proposing innovative approaches for Data Movement in Fog Computing. Due to the spirit of the workshop also preliminary ideas are more than welcome. Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and may not exceed six (6) single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (<a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE conference style</a>), including figures, tables, and references. Up to two (2) addtional pages can be purchases if needed.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>running prototypes</b> which demonstrate the feasibility of solutions that have been proposed to manage the data movement in Fog Computing. In this case, submissions must be limited to 2 pages where the approach is discussed and which also include a link to a video or a live prototype showing the capabilities of the demo.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               Authors should submit the manuscript in PDF format. All manuscripts will be reviewed and will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, rigour in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. In case of submissions about running prototypes, also maturity of the proposed product is taken into account.
            </p>
            <p>
               Papers conforming to the above guidelines can be submitted through the paper submission system <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=damove2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=damove2019</a> powered by EasyChair.org.
